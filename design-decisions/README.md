This directory is similar to an [Architectural Decision Record](https://adr.github.io/), but with more emphasis on being current and up to date, rather than recording past decisions. If you wanna view the evolution of a decision, use git.

The primary author of Pentive, Alex, is _not_ a good architect, designer, or web dev. Please open an issue if you see areas for improvement!

The multitude of services is partly due to separating endpoints that serve insecure user generated content from trusted Pentive content.

> [There are a few events in recent history that may have contributed to the current state of things. First, a whole army of developers writing JavaScript for the browser started self-identifying as “full-stack”, diving into server development and asynchronous code.](https://renegadeotter.com/2023/09/10/death-by-a-thousand-microservices.html)

😭 Trust me, I never thought I'd willingly write TypeScript/JavaScript (same thing).

# Service/Directory Overview

## app

- The client-side occasionally-online [SRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition#Software) that stores a user's templates/notes/cards
- Where card reviews occur

## app-ugc

- A small occasionally-online static site that displays untrusted user generated content (e.g. users' cards)
- Typically viewed through an iframe on `app` so JavaScript can't access `app`
- Has a service worker that queries `app` for media (e.g. images)

## hub

- The server-side always-online collaboration platform
- Where users may optionally upload notes for sharing

## hub-ugc

- Its raison d'être is the same as `app-ugc`'s - but for `hub`
- Always-online, so it doesn't need `app-ugc`'s fancy service worker

## lrpc

- short for (AWS) Lambda-RPC
- Mostly empty for now, except for the Prisma/PlanetScale schema
- Server-side syncing may eventually be implemented here

## cwa

- short for Cloudflare Worker API
- How `app` submits changes to `hub`/PlanetScale

## api-ugc

- The API serving untrusted user generated content from a secondary domain (e.g. `user-generated-content-pentive.com`)
- This is the _API_ - the other `ugc`s are sites (typically viewed through iframes)

## peer

- [PeerServer](https://github.com/peers/peerjs-server) that establishes p2p connections between Pentive apps for syncing client-side databases

## shared

- A library of shared code for the above services
