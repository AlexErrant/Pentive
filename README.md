# Pentive

A free, open source, offline-first [spaced repetition system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) that has first class support for collaboration, curation, and plugins. It's Reddit for flashcards.

## Plugins

Pentive has an extremely powerful plugin system. There is literally no limit to modding the UI. Any default UI component (I'm using [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/)) may be overwritten with a [custom element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements). See [example plugins](./example-plugins/).

## Contributing

If you're technically inclined, see [design decisions](./design-decisions/) for a review of Pentive's architecture and design. Contributions welcome!
