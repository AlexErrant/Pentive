This directory is similar to an [Architectural Decision Record](https://adr.github.io/), but with more emphasis on being current and up to date, rather than recording past decisions. If you wanna view the evolution of a decision, use git.

The primary author of Pentive, Alex, is _not_ a good architect, designer, or web dev. Please open an issue if you see areas for improvement!

# Service/Directory Overview

## app

- The client-side occasionally-online [SRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition#Software) that stores a user's templates/notes/cards
- Where card reviews occur

## app-ugc

- A small occasionally-online static site that displays untrusted user generated content (e.g. users' cards)
- Typically viewed through an iframe on `app` so JavaScript can't access `app`
- Has a service worker that queries `app` for media (e.g. images)

## hub

- The server-side always-online collaboration platform
- Where users may optionally upload notes for sharing

## hub-ugc

- Its raison d'Ãªtre is the same as `app-ugc`'s - but for `hub`
- Always-online, so it doesn't need `app-ugc`'s fancy service worker

## lrpc

- short for (AWS) Lambda-RPC
- Mostly empty for now, except for the Prisma/PlanetScale schema
- Server-side syncing may eventually be implemented here

## cwa

- short for Cloudflare Worker API
- How `app` submits changes to `hub`/PlanetScale

## api-ugc

- The API serving untrusted user generated content from a secondary domain (e.g. `user-generated-content-pentive.com`)
- This is the _API_ - the other `ugc`s are sites (typically viewed through iframes)

## peer

- [PeerServer](https://github.com/peers/peerjs-server) that establishes p2p connections between Pentive apps for syncing client-side databases

## shared

- A library of shared code for the above services
