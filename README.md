# Pentive

A free, open source, offline-first [spaced repetition system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) that has first class support for collaboration, curation, and plugins. It's Reddit for flashcards.

## Plugins

Pentive's plugin system allows developers to directly modify the dependency injection container. Any UI component may be overwritten with a function that returns any DOM node. See [example plugins](./example-plugins/).

## Contributing

If you're technically inclined, see [design decisions](./design-decisions/) for a review of Pentive's architecture and design. Contributions welcome!
