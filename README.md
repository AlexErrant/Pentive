# Pentive

A free, open source, [local-first](https://localfirstweb.dev/), [spaced repetition system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) that works offline, has p2p syncing, plugins, and first class support for collaboration. It's GitHub/Reddit for flashcards.

## Plugins

Pentive's plugin system allows developers to directly modify the dependency injection container. Any UI component may be overwritten with a function that returns any DOM node. See [example plugins](./example-plugins/).
