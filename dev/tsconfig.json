// This file is used by `npx tsc --build --watch`
// I go against the advice of Turborepo here https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/53116#issuecomment-1868601842
// and use projects for dev mode because running umpteen tsc processes leads to multiple logs for the same error.
// Also it's difficult to know when all the projects have finished typechecking, while it's obvious with just one tsc.
// This is in the /dev folder because "any changes in the Workspace root will cause all tasks to miss cache". https://turbo.build/repo/docs/guides/tools/typescript#you-likely-dont-need-a-tsconfigjson-file-in-the-root-of-your-project
