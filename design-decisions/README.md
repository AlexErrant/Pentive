This directory is similar to an [Architectural Decision Record](https://adr.github.io/), but with more emphasis on being current and up to date, rather than recording past decisions. If you wanna view the evolution of a decision, use git.

The primary author of Pentive, Alex, is _not_ a good architect, designer, or web dev. Please open an issue if you see areas for improvement!
