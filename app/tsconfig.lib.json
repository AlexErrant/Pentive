// `app` has two possible compile outputs - dist and lib.
// * dist is the output of `pnpm build` and is shipped to Cloudflare
// * lib is the output of `pnpm tsc-build` and is what's (eventually) published to npm. It's what's referenced by all the other projects in this monorepo since dist is minified and doesn't include type definitions.
//
// `vite build` doesn't support custom tsconfigs as per https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/10531 so we have to name this file `tsconfig.lib.json`.
// I am too dumb to get @rollup/plugin-typescript and/or esbuild's tsconfigRaw working, and vite-plugin-custom-tsconfig doesn't like it if you already have a `tsconfig.json`
